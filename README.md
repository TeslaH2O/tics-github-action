## TICS GitHub Action
The TiCS Github action integrates TICS Client analysis to measure your code quality. The incorporated Quality gating feature enables you to analyze and decorate pull requests.

### Prerequisites
- This action requires a valid TiCS license.
- You need to have a TICS Viewer running somewhere on the network that is HTTP accessible by the runner on which you want to execute the action.

### Restrictions
- This action should only be triggered on a pull request.
- It is not working for forked repositories.

### Adding the TiCS Action to a GitHub Workflow

```
- name: Run TICS Action
  uses: tiobe/tics-github-action@v1.0.0
  env: 
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}}
  with:
    projectName: 'myproject' 
    ticsViewerUrl: 'http://myviewer:20212/tiobeweb/section/api/cfg?name=myconfiguration'          
    clientToken: 'mycdtoken'                                        
```

### Example workflow 
The workflow YAML file will usually look something like this:

```
name: Main Workflow 

on:
  pull_request: 
        types: [ opened, edited, synchronize, reopened ] 

jobs:
  TiCS-CI:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - namee: TiCS Analysis and Quality check
        uses: tiobe/tics-github-action@v1.0.0
        env: 
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}}
          TICSAUTHTOKEN: ${{secrets.TICSAUTHTOKEN}}
        with:
          projectName: 'myproject'
          ticsConfiguration: 'https:/myviewer/tiobeweb/section/api/cfg?name=myconfiguration'
          clientToken: 'myclienttoken'
          calc: 'GATE'
          installTics: true
```

### Environment Variables
The environment variables that are necessary for the action to function:

```
env: 
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN}}
    TICSAUTHTOKEN: ${{secrets.TICSAUTHTOKEN}}
```

- `TICSAUTHTOKEN` - It is mandatory only when the TiCS viewer is not publicly available and requires authentication.
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` â€“ Provided by Github (see [Authenticating with the GITHUB_TOKEN](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/authenticating-with-the-github_token)).
