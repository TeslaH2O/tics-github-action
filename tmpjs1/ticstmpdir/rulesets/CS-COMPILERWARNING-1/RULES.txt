CS0067	3	Compiler Warning	The event 'event' is never used
CS0078	4	Compiler Warning	The 'l' suffix is easily confused with the digit '1' -- use 'L' for clarity
CS0105	3	Compiler Warning	The using directive for 'namespace' appeared previously in this namespace
CS0108	2	Compiler Warning	'member1' hides inherited member 'member2'. Use the new keyword if hiding was intended.
CS0109	4	Compiler Warning	The member 'member' does not hide an inherited member. The new keyword is not required
CS0114	2	Compiler Warning	'function1' hides inherited member 'function2'. To make the current method override that implementation, add the override keyword. Otherwise add the new keyword.

CS0253	2	Compiler Warning	Possible unintended reference comparison; to get a value comparison, cast the right hand side to type 'type'
CS0278	2	Compiler Warning	'type' does not implement the 'pattern name' pattern. 'method name' is ambiguous with 'method name'.
CS0279	2	Compiler Warning	'type name' does not implement the 'pattern name' pattern. 'method name' is either static or not public.
CS0280	2	Compiler Warning	'type' does not implement the 'pattern name' pattern. 'method name' has the wrong signature.
CS0282	3	Compiler Warning	There is no defined ordering between fields in multiple declarations of partial class or struct 'type'. To specify an ordering, all instance fields must be in the same declaration.

CS0437	2	Compiler Warning	The type 'type' in 'assembly2' conflicts with the imported namespace 'namespace' in 'fassembly1'. Using the type defined in 'assembly'.
CS0440	2	Compiler Warning	Defining an alias named 'global' is ill-advised since 'global::' always references the global namespace and not an alias
CS0444	2	Compiler Warning	Predefined type 'type name 1' was not found in 'System namespace 1' but was found in 'System namespace 2'
CS0458	2	Compiler Warning	The result of the expression is always 'null' of type 'type name'

CS0469	2	Compiler Warning	The 'goto case' value is not implicitly convertible to type 'type'
CS0472	2	Compiler Warning	The result of the expression is always 'value1' since a value of type 'value2' is never equal to 'null' of type 'value3'
CS0473	2	Compiler Warning	Explicit interface implementation '{0}' matches more than one interface member. Which interface member is actually chosen is implementation-dependent. Consider using a non-explicit implementation instead.

CS0642	3	Compiler Warning	Possible mistaken empty statement
CS0649	4	Compiler Warning	Field 'field' is never assigned to, and will always have its default value 'value'
CS0652	2	Compiler Warning	Comparison to integral constant is useless; the constant is outside the range of type 'type'
CS0657	1	Compiler Warning	'attribute modifier' is not a valid attribute location for this declaration. Valid attribute locations for this declaration are 'locations'. All attributes in this block will be ignored.
CS0658	1	Compiler Warning	'attribute modifier' is not a recognized attribute location. All attributes in this block will be ignored.

CS0688	1	Compiler Warning	'method1' has a link demand, but overrides or implements 'method2' which does not have a link demand. A security hole may exist.
CS0693	3	Compiler Warning	Type parameter 'type parameter' has the same name as the type parameter from outer type 'type'
CS0728	2	Compiler Warning	Possibly incorrect assignment to local 'variable' which is the argument to a using or lock statement. The Dispose call or unlocking will happen on the original value of the local.

CS1064	3	Compiler Warning	The best overloaded Add method '{0}' for the collection initializer element is obsolete.
CS1066	2	Compiler Warning	The default value specified for parameter '{0}' will have no effect because it applies to a member that is used in contexts that do not allow optional arguments
