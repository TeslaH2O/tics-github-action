detekt.TooGenericExceptionThrown	1	Exceptions	This rule reports thrown exceptions that have a type that is too generic.
detekt.ForEachOnRange	3	Performance	Using the forEach method on ranges has a heavy performance cost. Prefer using simple for loops.
detekt.SpreadOperator	3	Performance	Using a spread operator causes a full copy of the array to be created before calling a method. This has a very high performance penalty.
detekt.UnnecessaryTemporaryInstantiation	3	Performance	Avoid temporary objects when converting primitive types to String. This has a performance penalty when compared to using primitive types directly.
detekt.DuplicateCaseInWhenExpression	2	Potential Bugs	Flags duplicate case statements in when expressions.
detekt.EqualsWithHashCodeExist	1	Potential Bugs	When a class overrides the equals() method it should also override the hashCode() method.
detekt.ExplicitGarbageCollectionCall	1	Potential Bugs	Reports all calls to explicitly trigger the Garbage Collector. Code should work independently of the garbage collector and should not require the GC to be triggered in certain points in time.
detekt.UnreachableCode	2	Potential Bugs	Reports unreachable code. This unreachable code should be removed as it serves no purpose.
detekt.ClassNaming	5	Style	Class name does not conform to the style guide.
detekt.EnumNaming	5	Style	Enum name does not conform to the style guide.
detekt.ForbiddenComment	5	Style	Do not use forbidden comments.
detekt.FunctionNaming	5	Style	Function name does not conform to the style guide.
detekt.ModifierOrder	5	Style	Use modifiers in the correct order.
detekt.ObjectPropertyNaming	5	Style	Object property name does not conform to the style guide.
detekt.OptionalAbstractKeyword	5	Style	Do not use abstract modifiers that are unnecessary and can be removed.
detekt.PackageNaming	5	Style	Package name does not conform to the style guide.

detekt.ThrowsCount	5	Style	Do not use too many throws from a single function.
detekt.TopLevelPropertyNaming	5	Style	Top level property name does not conform to the style guide.
detekt.VariableNaming	5	Style	Variable name does not conform to the style guide.
