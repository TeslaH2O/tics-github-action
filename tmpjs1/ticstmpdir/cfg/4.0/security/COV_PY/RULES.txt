COV_PY_CONFIG.DJANGO_CSRF_PROTECTION_DISABLED_PYTHON	3	Audit impact security	An attacker may trick a client into making an unintentional request to the web server which will be treated as an authentic request. It may result in unintended execution of sensitive functionality or in exposure of data if no CSRF protection is enabled.
COV_PY_CONFIG.ENABLED_DEBUG_MODE_PYTHON	3	Audit impact security	Audit the debug mode configuration. When enabled in the production code it leads to security risks because error handlers will display verbose error messages that may contain sensitive information.
COV_PY_HOST_HEADER_VALIDATION_DISABLED_PYTHON	3	Audit impact security	Not configuring host validation properly for a Django application may lead to host header attacks used to accomplish cross-site request forgery, cache poisoning, and poisoning links in emails.
COV_PY_INSECURE_COOKIE_PYTHON	3	Audit impact security	An attacker may trick a client into making an unintentional request to the web server which will be treated as an authentic request and include the CSRF token contained in the CSRF cookie. It may result in unintended execution of sensitive functionality.
COV_PY_INSECURE_REFERRER_POLICY_PYTHON	3	Audit impact security	The Referrer-Policy HTTP header controls how browsers set the Referer HTTP header, which may expose the page the user visited before.
COV_PY_WEAK_URL_SANITIZATION_PYTHON	3	Audit impact security	Malicious URLs can bypass the weak regular expression. The incomplete check might cause attacks such as request forgeries and malicious redirects.

COV_PY_CSRF_PYTHON	1	High impact security	Controllers that execute actions or tasks may be accessed to perform activities without the user's knowledge or authorization. These attacks are difficult to distinguish from legitimate requests.
COV_PY_OS_CMD_INJECTION_PYTHON	1	High impact security	A user can change the intent of an operating system command. This change may result in the disclosure, destruction, or modification of sensitive data or operating system resources.
COV_PY_PATH_MANIPULATION_PYTHON	1	High impact security	An attacker may access, modify, or corrupt files that contain sensitive information or are critical to the application.
COV_PY_SCRIPT_CODE_INJECTION_PYTHON	1	High impact security	An attacker may be able to alter the behavior of the program or run malicious code.
COV_PY_SQLI_PYTHON	1	High impact security	A user can change the intent of the SQL query, which may inappropriately disclose or corrupt data within the database.
COV_PY_TEMPLATE_INJECTION_PYTHON	1	High impact security	An attacker may be able to alter the behavior of the program in an unintended way or run malicious code.
COV_PY_UNSAFE_DESERIALIZATION_PYTHON	1	High impact security	An attacker can instantiate arbitrary classes, possibly resulting in a denial of service or potentially unintended code execution.
COV_PY_XSS_PYTHON	1	High impact security	A user can execute arbitrary JavaScript on a web page viewed or accessed by another user, potentially allowing session hijacking, disclosing sensitive data in the DOM, or viewing of keyboard and mouse events.

COV_PY_ANONYMOUS_DB_CONNECTION_PYTHON	3	Low impact security	The attacker who has access to the network where the database is hosted can connect to the database that allows anonymous connections by just knowing the host and the port number, which is easy to obtain by mapping the network.
COV_PY_COOKIE_INJECTION_PYTHON	3	Low impact security	An attacker may be able to set a session ID (session fixation), change the scope or expiration time of a cookie, and otherwise affect the application's behavior by setting new cookies.
COV_PY_INSUFFICIENT_LOGGING_PYTHON	3	Low impact security	Detecting a security incident may take longer without sufficient logging. Delaying detection increases potential damage and mitigation effort.
COV_PY_JINJA2_AUTOESCAPE_DISABLED_PYTHON	3	Low impact security	Disabling Jinja2 autoescape protections allows an attacker to write untrusted data to the template which, when rendered, can result in cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
COV_PY_MISSING_PASSWORD_VALIDATOR_PYTHON	3	Low impact security	Without password validators users may set low complexity passwords that are easily guessable and quickly brute-forced by attackers.
COV_PY_REGEX_INJECTION_PYTHON	3	Low impact security	An attacker may be able to retrieve sensitive information, alter the behavior of the program, or exhaust resources within the application.
COV_PY_SECURE_TEMP_PYTHON	3	Low impact security	An attacker may exploit the race condition to manipulate the temporary file before it is used by the application, causing unexpected behavior and potentially bypassing application security controls.
COV_PY_URL_MANIPULATION_PYTHON	3	Low impact security	An attacker may access unintended server-side functionality or make the application access a malicious website.
COV_PY_XML_INJECTION_PYTHON	3	Low impact security	An attacker may be able to insert unintended content or structure to subvert the application's logic.

COV_PY_BAD_CERT_VERIFICATION_PYTHON	2	Medium impact security	When host validation policy is set to accept unknown host keys, it makes the application vulnerable to man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks.
COV_PY_HARDCODED_CREDENTIALS_PYTHON	2	Medium impact security	Users with access to this source code can use these credentials to access production services or data.  Changing these credentials requires changing the code and re-deploying the application.
COV_PY_HEADER_INJECTION_PYTHON	2	Medium impact security	An attacker may be able to set important HTTP headers and disable security protections or fix the session ID. The severity of the defect depends on which headers can be manipulated and if the attacker is able to directly or indirectly control the header value.
COV_PY_INSECURE_COMMUNICATION_PYTHON	2	Medium impact security	Sensitive data is transmitted over an insecure communication channel and can be read and modified by attackers.
COV_PY_INSECURE_NETWORK_BIND_PYTHON	2	Medium impact security	The application may expose sensitive information to an attacker, since the socket is reachable via the interface that the application does not expect to be listening on.
COV_PY_INSECURE_RANDOM_PYTHON	2	Medium impact security	An attacker may be able to predict the values generated by a cryptographically weak PRNG and gain access to sensitive information.
COV_PY_INSECURE_SALT_PYTHON	2	Medium impact security	Given the salt and the output of a hash function, an attacker with enough resources can feasibly compute the input that yields that output.  Re-using the same salt for many uses of the hash function reduces the cost for the attacker to reverse a large number of hashes.
COV_PY_MISSING_AUTHZ_PYTHON	2	Medium impact security	Missing or insufficient authorization may permit unintended users to perform actions or access sensitive data for which they do not have permission.
COV_PY_NOSQL_QUERY_INJECTION_PYTHON	2	Medium impact security	An attacker can change the intent of the NoSQL query, which may bypass security controls or disclose unauthorized data.
COV_PY_OPEN_REDIRECT_PYTHON	2	Medium impact security	An attacker can mount a phishing attack by modifying the URL value to point to a malicious Web site.
COV_PY_RISKY_CRYPTO_PYTHON	2	Medium impact security	A violation of user-specified RISKY_CRYPTO policy was detected.
COV_PY_SENSITIVE_DATA_LEAK_PYTHON	2	Medium impact security	Exception error messages and stack traces may leak information useful for attacking the application.
COV_PY_UNSAFE_XML_PARSE_CONFIG_PYTHON	2	Medium impact security	Unsafe XML parsing configuration is vulnerable to various attacks, such as XML external entity attack, billion laughs attack, XML parsing recovery error attack, and Xinclude attack.
COV_PY_WEAK_PASSWORD_HASH_PYTHON	2	Medium impact security	A weak password hashing algorithm does not adequately protect the password, as the computational effort required to retrieve passwords from their hashes might be insufficient to deter large-scale, password-cracking attacks.
COV_PY_XML_EXTERNAL_ENTITY_PYTHON	2	Medium impact security	Resolving arbitrary external entities may result in exposing sensitive data or in making unwanted server requests.
