COV_CONFIG.ENABLED_DEBUG_MODE_TYPESCRIPT	3	Audit impact security	Having a debug statement in the production code leads to security risks because it modifies the behavior of the application in an unexpected way.
COV_CONFIG.HARDCODED_CREDENTIALS_AUDIT_TYPESCRIPT	1	Audit impact security	Having hardcoded credentials in configuration files accessible to potentially malicious users leads an attacker using those credential to gain access to the application's data and services.
COV_CONFIG.HARDCODED_TOKEN_TYPESCRIPT	2	Audit impact security	Having a hardcoded token in configuration files accessible to potentially malicious users leads to security risks, because an attacker could use the token to gain access to application's data and services.
COV_CORS_MISCONFIGURATION_AUDIT_TYPESCRIPT	2	Audit impact security	Allowing an attacker to specify any HTTP header on a CORS request may help with bypassing authorization and CSRF controls.
COV_DNS_PREFETCHING_TYPESCRIPT	2	Audit impact security	DNS prefetching may leak sensitive information to an attacker on the same network by disclosing information about other resources used on the page.
COV_EXPRESS_WINSTON_SENSITIVE_LOGGING_TYPESCRIPT	2	Audit impact security	Storing sensitive information within log files may lead to financial loss or reputation damage to users and companies and assist attackers in gaining access to systems via information exposure.
COV_INSECURE_ACL_TYPESCRIPT	2	Audit impact security	Insecure permission assignment could lead to exposure of sensitive information or modification of the resource by malicious parties. This is especially dangerous when the resource is related to application configuration, execution, or contains sensitive user data.
COV_INSECURE_COOKIE_TYPESCRIPT	3	Audit impact security	While web browsers send cookies with the 'secure' attribute only over HTTPS, they do send cookies without it over HTTP. If an attacker can fool the victim's browser into sending an HTTP request to the vulnerable site (for example, with JavaScript code on a malicious page or with a phishing link), the victim's browser will send the vulnerable cookie in clear text. If the attacker can also intercept this network traffic, then they can steal the victim's session cookie and impersonate the victim.
COV_INSECURE_REFERRER_POLICY_TYPESCRIPT	2	Audit impact security	The Referrer-Policy HTTP header controls how browsers set the Referrer HTTP header, which may expose the page the user visited before.
COV_REACT_DANGEROUS_INNERHTML_TYPESCRIPT	2	Audit impact security	Dynamically setting the value of the innerHTML property without correctly sanitizing the data may lead to cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.
COV_UNSAFE_BUFFER_METHOD_TYPESCRIPT	3	Audit impact security	If an attacker is able to read the contents of the uninitialized buffer objects, the attacker may access sensitive data from system memory.
COV_VUE_TEMPLATE_UNSAFE_VHTML_DIRECTIVE_TYPESCRIPT	3	Audit impact security	The use of 'v-html' directive does not necessarily manifest a security vulnerability, but if untrusted data is assigned to this directive, it will result in a cross-site scripting.
COV_WEAK_URL_SANITIZATION_TYPESCRIPT	1	Audit impact security	Malicious URLs can bypass the weak regular expression. The incomplete check might cause attacks such as request forgeries and malicious redirects.

COV_CONFIG.MYSQL_SSL_VERIFY_DISABLED_TYPESCRIPT	3	Low impact security	The application does not validate the SSL certificate used to connect to the database which may lead to sensitive data leakage.
COV_CONFIG.REQUEST_STRICTSSL_DISABLED_TYPESCRIPT	3	Low impact security	The code does not validate the SSL certificate used to request resources which may lead to man-in-the-middle attacks and leaking sensitive data.

COV_ANGULAR_BYPASS_SECURITY_TYPESCRIPT	2	Medium impact security	Marks the call to one of the bypassSecurityTrust...functions
COV_ANGULAR_ELEMENT_REFERENCE_TYPESCRIPT	2	Medium impact security	Reported for a call to ElementRef.nativeElement where the element's innerHTML attribute is written or querySelector is called on the element
COV_LOCALSTORAGE_WRITE_TYPESCRIPT	2	Medium impact security	A write to the localStorage using a native JavaScript API or through one of the Angular localStorage plugins: ngx-pwa or angularwebstorage-service
