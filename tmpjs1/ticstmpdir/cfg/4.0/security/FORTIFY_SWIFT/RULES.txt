FortifySwiftWeakWSSecurityPolicyTokensNotProtected	1	Weak WS-SecurityPolicy	When token protection is not enabled, the integrity of tokens might not be guaranteed since token protection enforces token signing.
FortifySwiftWeakWSSecurityPolicyWeakToken	1	Weak WS-SecurityPolicy	Using a UsernameToken with a plain text password over an unencrypted channel exposes the password to attackers who can sniff the SOAP messages.
FortifySwiftWeakXMLSchemaLaxProcessing	3	Weak XML Schema	When the processContents attribute is set to lax or skip, no input validation is performed for wildcard elements and attributes.
FortifySwiftWeakXMLSchemaTypeAny	3	Weak XML Schema	The <any> element makes it easier to perform attacks like XML injection.
FortifySwiftWeakXMLSchemaUnboundedOccurrences	3	Weak XML Schema	Setting a maxOccurs value to unbounded can lead to resources exhaustion and ultimately a denial of service.
FortifySwiftWeakXMLSchemaUndefinedNamespace	3	Weak XML Schema	Specifying a namespace of ##any in the <any> element means the schema allows elements beyond what is explicitly defined in the schema, thereby making it easier to craft malicious documents.
FortifySwiftWebServerMisconfigurationAccountInformation	2	Web Server Misconfiguration	Disclosure of user account information could allow an attacker to impersonate a user with higher privileges, steal sensitive information or execute arbitrary commands.
FortifySwiftWebServerMisconfigurationCaseSensitivity	2	Web Server Misconfiguration	Failure to properly restrict access to application resources could allow an attacker to steal sensitive information.
FortifySwiftWebServerMisconfigurationDeprecatedSSLTLSCertificate	2	Web Server Misconfiguration	Use of a deprecated SSL/TLS certificate on the target server can compromise the privacy and integrity of user data on the communication channel.
FortifySwiftWebServerMisconfigurationDirectoryListing	2	Web Server Misconfiguration	Listing directory contents without restriction can expose sensitive information and private resources.
FortifySwiftWebServerMisconfigurationExpiredSSLCertificate	2	Web Server Misconfiguration	Presenting an invalid certificate breaks the trust relationship between the client and the server and could also make it easier for an attacker to trick victim into accepting a spoofed SSL certificate.
FortifySwiftWebServerMisconfigurationHTTPBasicAuthentication	2	Web Server Misconfiguration	Using HTTP Basic authentication mechanism over insecure channel can allow attackers to steal credentials.
FortifySwiftWebServerMisconfigurationInformationDisclosure	2	Web Server Misconfiguration	Failure to restrict access to files could lead to exposure of sensitive information or interfaces.
FortifySwiftWebServerMisconfigurationInsecureContentTypeSetting	2	Web Server Misconfiguration	Failure to correctly enforce the content-type could allow an attacker to conduct Cross-Site Scripting or information theft attacks.
FortifySwiftWebServerMisconfigurationInsecureMappingDirectives	2	Web Server Misconfiguration	Misconfiguration of mapping directives can allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to sensitive resources.
FortifySwiftWebServerMisconfigurationMissingUnicodeCharset	2	Web Server Misconfiguration	Allowing user input to control the web page's character set could allow an attacker to bypass application's user input filters.
FortifySwiftWebServerMisconfigurationOpenProxyAccess	2	Web Server Misconfiguration	A proxy server allowing CONNECT or GET requests without any restriction can enable an attacker to masquerade the origin of their attacks or access resources internal to the network.
FortifySwiftWebServerMisconfigurationOPTIONSHTTPMethod	2	Web Server Misconfiguration	Revealing the HTTP methods supported by web server configuration helps an adversary learn further about the system and form a specific plan of attack.
FortifySwiftWebServerMisconfigurationRequestThrottlingNotEnabled	2	Web Server Misconfiguration	Misconfiguration of a server could leave the application vulnerable to Denial of Service attacks.
FortifySwiftWebServerMisconfigurationResponseHeaders	2	Web Server Misconfiguration	Each browser responds differently to an incorrectly formatted response header which may pose security implication.
FortifySwiftWebServerMisconfigurationServerErrorMessage	2	Web Server Misconfiguration	Server error responses could offer invaluable information about the application and the server allowing an attacker to formulate more effective attack payloads.

FortifySwiftWebServerMisconfigurationServletRuntimeError	2	Web Server Misconfiguration	Unhandled runtime exceptions could reveal sensitive system information or lead to denial of service conditions.
FortifySwiftWebServerMisconfigurationSOAPExceptionMessage	2	Web Server Misconfiguration	An unhandled SOAP exception could reveal sensitive system information or trigger a denial of service condition.
FortifySwiftWebServerMisconfigurationSSLCertificateHostnameDiscrepancy	2	Web Server Misconfiguration	Incorrect SSL certificate information can cause the validation process to fail, negating the security benefits of using a certificate to verify the server is trusted.
FortifySwiftWebServerMisconfigurationUnprotectedDirectory	2	Web Server Misconfiguration	Insecure deployment and exposure of directories can supply attackers with invaluable information about the application enabling them to conduct targeted attacks.
FortifySwiftWebServerMisconfigurationUnprotectedFile	2	Web Server Misconfiguration	Insecure deployment and exposure of files can supply attackers with invaluable information about the application enabling them to orchestrate targeted attacks.
