// Coverity 2022.03 and below
COV_CPP_CHROOT	2	API usage errors	If a call to chroot is not followed by a call to chdir("/") the chroot jail confinement can be violated

COV_CPP_BUFFER_SIZE_04	1	Buffers	Incorrect buffer manipulation using the wrong sizes may result in buffer overflow
COV_CPP_BUFFER_SIZE_WARNING_01	2	Buffers	If the buffer is treated as a null terminated string in later operations, a buffer overflow or over-read may occur

COV_CPP_OPEN_ARGS	3	File Creation	The permissions on the file created will be arbitrary and possibly insecure.
COV_CPP_SECURE_TEMP	3	File Creation	Using an insecure temporary file creation function

COV_CPP_TOCTOU	2	Files	A check occurs on a file's attributes before the file is used in a privileged operation, but things may have changed

COV_CPP_PW.NON_CONST_PRINTF_FORMAT_STRING	2	Format Strings	A non-constant printf format string may be susceptible to format string attacks

COV_CPP_OS_CMD_INJECTION	1	High impact security	A user can change the intent of an operating system command. This change may result in the disclosure, destruction, or modification of sensitive data or operating system resources.
COV_CPP_PATH_MANIPULATION	1	High impact security	An attacker may access, modify, or corrupt files that contain sensitive information or are critical to the application.
COV_CPP_SQLI	1	High impact security	A user can change the intent of the SQL query, which may inappropriately disclose or corrupt data within the database.
COV_CPP_UNENCRYPTED_SENSITIVE_DATA	1	High impact security	Attackers can read the sensitive data from the cookie with widely available tools.
COV_CPP_WEAK_PASSWORD_HASH	1	High impact security	An attacker may recover passwords with feasible amounts of computational effort.
COV_CPP_Y2K38_SAFETY	1	High impact quality	The time value stored in this integer will represent a different, but possibly valid, time.

COV_CPP_AUDIT.SPECULATIVE_EXECUTION_DATA_LEAK	3	Low impact security	If the memory access used as an index is out-of-bounds an attacker might be able to read the process' memory.
COV_CPP_WEAK_GUARD	3	Low impact security	An attacker that compromises a DNS server or pollutes its cache can bypass this check.

COV_CPP_HARDCODED_CREDENTIALS	2	Medium impact security	Users with access to this source code can use this key to access encrypted production data.  Changing this key requires changing the code and re-deploying the application.
COV_CPP_HEADER_INJECTION	2	Medium impact security	An attacker may be able to set important HTTP headers and disable security protections or fix the session ID. The severity of the defect depends on which headers can be manipulated and if the attacker is able to directly or indirectly control the header value.
COV_CPP_SENSITIVE_DATA_LEAK	2	Medium impact security	Exception error messages and stack traces may leak information useful for attacking the application.
COV_CPP_URL_MANIPULATION	2	Medium impact security	An attacker may access unintended files or make the application access a malicious website.
COV_CPP_XPATH_INJECTION	2	Medium impact security	An attacker can change the intent of the XPath query, which may inappropriately disclose data or grant unauthorized access to application functionality.


COV_CPP_UNSAFE_XML_PARSE_CONFIG	2	Miscellaneous	Unsafe XML parsing configuration is vulnerable to various attacks, such as XML external entity attack, billion laughs attack, XML parsing recovery error attack, Xinclude attack.

COV_CPP_DC.STREAM_BUFFER	2	Risky Functions	The called function is unsafe for security related code
COV_CPP_DC.STRING_BUFFER	2	Risky Functions	The called function is unsafe for security related code
COV_CPP_DC.WEAK_CRYPTO	2	Risky Functions	The called function is unsafe for security related code
COV_CPP_SECURE_CODING	3	Risky Functions	Calling a function which may pose a security risk if it is used inappropriately

COV_CPP_TAINTED_SCALAR_01	2	Scalars	The array index could be controlled by an attacker, leading to reads outside the bounds of the array
COV_CPP_USER_POINTER	2	Scalars	A user-land pointer is dereferenced without safety checks in the kernel

COV_CPP_DC.PREDICTABLE_KEY_PASSWORD	2	Security best practices violations	May result in a security violation
COV_CPP_FORMAT_STRING_INJECTION	3	Security best practices violations	A non-constant format string can potentially be exploited by a user to take control of the application.
COV_CPP_RISKY_CRYPTO_01	3	Security best practices violations	A use of a weak cryptographic method was detected. There exist known ways to compromise the security of the encrypted data

COV_CPP_STRING_NULL	2	Strings	The function may iterate past the end of the buffer looking for a null terminator
COV_CPP_STRING_OVERFLOW_01	2	Strings	he string operation will write past the end of the fixed-size destination buffer if the source buffer is too large
COV_CPP_STRING_SIZE	2	Strings	The string operation can write past the end of the fixed-size destination buffer if the source buffer is too large
COV_CPP_TAINTED_STRING_01	2	Strings	An attacker could craft a format string containing unexpected formatting directives and force a buffer overflow, which may be used to take control of the application
COV_CPP_TAINTED_STRING_WARNING_01	3	Strings	A non-constant string used to construct a format string
