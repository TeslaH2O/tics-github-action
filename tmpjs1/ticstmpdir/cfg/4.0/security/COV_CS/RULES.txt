COV_CS_UNENCRYPTED_SENSITIVE_DATA	1	High impact security	Attackers can read the sensitive data from the cookie with widely available tools.
COV_CS_UNSAFE_DESERIALIZATION	1	High impact security	An attacker can instantiate arbitrary classes, possibly resulting in a denial of service or potentially unintended code execution.
COV_CS_WEAK_PASSWORD_HASH	1	High impact security	An attacker may recover passwords with feasible amounts of computational effort.
COV_CS_XSS	1	High impact security	A user can execute arbitrary JavaScript on a web page viewed or accessed by another user, potentially allowing session hijacking, disclosing sensitive data in the DOM, or viewing of keyboard and mouse events.

COV_CS_INSECURE_RANDOM	2	Insecure random category	An attacker may be able to predict the values generated by a cryptographically weak PRNG and gain access to sensitive information.

COV_CS_ASPNET_MVC_VERSION_HEADER	3	Low impact security	Not setting MvcHandler.DisableMvcResponseHeader to true in function Application_Start or its callees reveals information about the specific version of ASP.NET MVC on the target system.
COV_CS_CONFIG.ASP_VIEWSTATE_MAC	3	Low impact security	In .NET 4.5.1 and earlier, disabling View State Machine Authentication Code (MAC) generation potentially allows an attacker to upload and execute arbitrary code on the web server.
COV_CS_CONFIG.ASPNET_VERSION_HEADER	3	Low impact security	Setting enableVersionHeader to true reveals information about the specific version of ASP.NET running on the system. This can be used to target security vulnerabilities in the specific version.
COV_CS_CONFIG.CONNECTION_STRING_PASSWORD	3	Low impact security	Unencrypted passwords in configuration files leak credentials to anyone with access to the file. These are often targeted by attackers.
COV_CS_CONFIG.COOKIES_MISSING_HTTPONLY	3	Low impact security	By enabling the HttpOnly attribute in the response header, modern browsers will disallow script access to cookie data. The cookie is still sent when the user visits a valid address, but any malicious code will be unable to transmit the cookie data back to the attacker's computer or web site.
COV_CS_CONFIG.DEAD_AUTHORIZATION_RULE	3	Low impact security	An allow rule is unreachable after one or more conflicting deny rules.
COV_CS_CONFIG.DYNAMIC_DATA_HTML_COMMENT	3	Low impact security	A user can obtain potentially sensitive information leaked through HTML comments.
COV_CS_CONFIG.ENABLED_DEBUG_MODE	3	Low impact security	Debug binaries will give detailed debugging messages which may expose sensitive server variables or configuration.
COV_CS_CONFIG.ENABLED_TRACE_MODE	3	Low impact security	Trace information will be displayed whenever the page is rendered which may expose sensitive server variables or configuration.
COV_CS_CONFIG.MISSING_CUSTOM_ERROR_PAGE	3	Low impact security	The default error page leaks sensitive information to potential attackers, including server details, exception messages, a stack trace, and source code.
COV_CS_REGEX_INJECTION	3	Low impact security	An attacker may be able to retrieve sensitive information, alter the behavior of the program, or exhaust resources within the application.
COV_CS_UNKNOWN_LANGUAGE_INJECTION	3	Low impact security	An attacker can change the intent of the parsing, which may alter how the data is interpreted.
COV_CS_UNSAFE_NAMED_QUERY	3	Low impact security	An attacker can subvert program functionality or expose sensitive data.

COV_CS_HARDCODED_CREDENTIALS	2	Medium impact security	Users with access to this source code can use this password to access production services or data.  Changing this password requires changing the code and re-deploying the application.
COV_CS_HEADER_INJECTION	2	Medium impact security	An attacker may be able to set important HTTP headers and disable security protections or fix the session ID. The severity of the defect depends on which headers can be manipulated and if the attacker is able to directly or indirectly control the header value.
COV_CS_INSECURE_COMMUNICATION	2	Medium impact security	Sensitive data sent to or received from the application may be read or manipulated by unintended actors.
COV_CS_MISSING_AUTHZ	2	Medium impact security	Missing or insufficient authorization may permit unintended users to perform actions or access sensitive data for which they do not have permission.
