// Coverity 2022.03 and below
COV_CS_SWAPPED_ARGUMENTS	1	API usage errors	The function call will not have its intended effect.

COV_CS_DUPLICATE_PROCESS	3	Build system issues	A process is executed multiple times during the build system
COV_CS_FILE_ACCESS	3	Build system issues	A file is accessed during the build system that falls outside the build's file access policy
COV_CS_FILE_LEAK	3	Build system issues	A file created during the build system is not cleaned up by the build in its clean step
COV_CS_POLICY	3	Build system issues	A process executed during the build violated a local build policy

COV_CS_CALL_SUPER	2	Class hierarchy inconsistencies	Overrider does not call the base class method, even though most other overriders do
COV_CS_FORWARD_CLASSCAST	2	Class hierarchy inconsistencies	Object is checked for compatibility with a particular subtype, but then later downcast without a check

COV_CS_MUTABLE_COMPARISON	3	Code maintainability issues	The CompareTo method should not read from non-constant fields
COV_CS_MUTABLE_HASHCODE	3	Code maintainability issues	The GetHashCode method should not read from non-constant fields

COV_CS_ATOMICITY	2	Concurrent data access violations	Critical section does not protect read-update-write of a concurrently shared value
COV_CS_BAD_LOCK_OBJECT_01	2	Concurrent data access violations	Locking upon an object which is a poor choice due to too broad, too narrow, or too unpredictable aliasing behavior.
COV_CS_GUARDED_BY_VIOLATION	2	Concurrent data access violations	Thread shared data is accessed without holding an appropriate lock, possibly causing a race condition
COV_CS_INDIRECT_GUARDED_BY_VIOLATION	2	Concurrent data access violations	Thread shared data is accessed without holding an appropriate lock, possibly causing a race condition
COV_CS_NON_STATIC_GUARDING_STATIC	2	Concurrent data access violations	Static field is protected by a per-instance lock
COV_CS_VOLATILE_ATOMICITY	2	Concurrent data access violations	A volatile variable is updated in a non-atomic manner

COV_CS_DEADCODE_01	2	Control flow issues	Code can never be reached because of a logical contradiction
COV_CS_MISSING_RESTORE_01	2	Control flow issues	Failure to restore non-local value
COV_CS_NESTING_INDENT_MISMATCH_02	2	Control flow issues	The indentation of this code suggests it is nested when it is not.
COV_CS_STRAY_SEMICOLON	2	Control flow issues	A semicolon was erroneously inserted at a wrong point in the code, e.g. after an if, lock, while, or for construct and before the block
COV_CS_UNEXPECTED_CONTROL_FLOW	3	Control flow issues	Execution jumps out of the loop rather than continuing.
COV_CS_UNREACHABLE	2	Control flow issues	Code block is unreachable because of the syntactic structure of the code

COV_CS_LOCK_EVASION	2	Data race undermines locking	The data guarded by this critical section may be read while in an inconsistent state or modified by multiple racing threads.

COV_CS_CHECKED_RETURN_01	2	Error handling issues	Value returned from a function is not checked for errors before being used
COV_CS_MISSING_THROW	2	Error handling issues	An object of exception type is created but neither thrown nor stored anywhere; the developer likely intended to throw the exception.


COV_CS_BAD_EQ_01	1	Incorrect expression	Using wrong equality operation (Equals or the equivalent method vs "==") for this type
COV_CS_BAD_EQ_TYPES	1	Incorrect expression	The equality test will always return false.
COV_CS_COPY_PASTE_ERROR	1	Incorrect expression	The copied code will not have its intended effect.
COV_CS_IDENTICAL_BRANCHES	1	Incorrect expression	The case is redundant or can be combined
COV_CS_PROPERTY_MIXUP	2	Incorrect expression	Setting property in a method with different name is suspicious
COV_CS_UNINTENDED_INTEGER_DIVISION	2	Incorrect expression	When dividing two values of integer types, integer division is used, which ignores any remainder. When such a result is used in a context expecting a floating-point number, it is likely that floating-point division was intended.
COV_CS_UNUSED_VALUE	2	Incorrect expression	An assigned value that is never used may represent unnecessary computation, an incorrect algorithm, or possibly the need for cleanup or refactoring.
COV_CS_USELESS_CALL	1	Incorrect expression	A function call that seems to have an intended effect has no actual effect on the logic of the program

COV_CS_BAD_SHIFT	2	Integer handling issues	The operation may yield an unexpected result.
COV_CS_CONSTANT_EXPRESSION_RESULT	1	Integer handling issues	An operation with non-constant operands that computes a result with constant value
COV_CS_DIVIDE_BY_ZERO_02	2	Integer handling issues	Division or modulo by zero results in undefined behavior.
COV_CS_OVERFLOW_BEFORE_WIDEN	2	Integer handling issues	An integer overflow occurs, with the result converted to a wider integer type

COV_CS_MS.*	3	Microsoft: Miscellaneous	Unclassified warning from Microsoft Code Analysis


COV_CS_FORWARD_NULL_01	1	Null pointer dereferences	Reference may be null but is then dereferenced anyway
COV_CS_NULL_RETURNS_01	2	Null pointer dereferences	Return value of function which returns null is dereferenced without checking
COV_CS_REVERSE_INULL	1	Null pointer dereferences	There may be a null reference exception, or else the comparison against null is unnecessary.


COV_CS_INFINITE_LOOP	2	Program hangs	Infinite loop with unsatisfiable exit condition
COV_CS_LOCK_INVERSION	2	Program hangs	Threads may try to acquire two locks in different orders, potentially causing deadlock
COV_CS_LOCK_ORDERING	2	Program hangs	Threads may try to acquire three or more locks in different orders, potentially causing deadlock

COV_CS_RESOURCE_LEAK_02	1	Resource leaks	Leak of a system resource such as streams, channels, or other resources

COV_CS_TA.*	3	Test advisor issues	Code does not satisfy the testing policy established by your organization.
COV_CS_TA.INSUFFICIENT_COVERAGE	3	Test advisor issues	Function does not reach coverage threshold required by the policy
COV_CS_TA.INSUFFICIENT_FILE_COVERAGE	3	Test advisor issues	File does not reach coverage threshold required by the policy
COV_CS_TA.NO_COVERAGE	3	Test advisor issues	Function is not covered by any test
COV_CS_TA.UNCALLED	3	Test advisor issues	Function is not called from any test
